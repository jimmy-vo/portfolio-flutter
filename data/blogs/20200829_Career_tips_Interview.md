### Introduction
After I graduated from Red River College, I started to work for SolarSkyrise. Since then, I had 3 interviews at other companies. In August 2020, I got 2 offers but I have decided to work for [Librestream](#section-1-999). This opportunity gave me a short break in the transition time. Thanks to that, I had some time to reflex on my achievements and my efforts so far.

As [a tech lead at OriGatou](#section-1-888), I have met many IT students, graduates, and also Software developers. OriGatou is a start-up, but it is very different from other start-ups. It doesn't keep the employees stay and work for the company. It focuses on building up its people's personal career, so the people stay just because we were doing cool stuff and help them move up on their careers. From time to time, I gave new members professional advice on how to develop their careers. It also inspires me to write a blog series about career tips in Software Development.

I hope it would help more people, not just the people in my connection, who are new to Canada and want to launch their career in Software Development. The series includes:
* [Career tips: Acknowledge the struggles](blog/20200827)
* [Career tips: Develop strategies](blog/20200828)
* [Career tips: Stuff you should know about interviews](blog/20200829)

### Should you study about the company before the interview
"You should study the company on its website before the interview!"

All the people told me that, and also instructors at Red River College told me the same thing. However, I have my own thought.

First of all, as [a tech lead at OriGatou](#section-1-888), I would not select a candidate just because they spent 24 hours before the interview to study as much as they can about the company. What I would want from candidates is how their skills match the tasks and how quickly they can adapt to the new environment.

Another reason is it does not worth it to do it. Normally I would take a new team member 3 months to take them from knowing nothing about the business to the productive stage. It may take up to a year for a new employee to feel comfortable in a large organization where the product structure or business logic is complicated. So why would you have to waste your time to study about the company that you are not even sure you will have a chance to work there or not. Before an interview, I would rather study the job posting to find the skills they need and organize my ideas to present them better. And, keep yourself busy by doing the same thing with many other companies.

However, it may be true in some situations. If you are fresher, and you have no other skills except for the courses at school, studying the company may help. But I don't think it will help much, because you don't have anything to compete with other candidates. So if you are in the situation when you don't have enough time to acquire new skills because the interview happens tomorrow, plus you don't have any other plan, yes, you can spend your time study about the company.

### Know the person who you are talking to
This is just my personal experience thatÂ happens with me and other colleagues I discussed with. In an interview, you should know the person you are talking to, at least their title. That helps you move further to the next interview. Depending on company and position, you may talk to 3 types of people: Human Resource (HR), Technical, and Director/Manager.

A technical interview is the most important and it is the most time-consuming, where you need to show off as much as possible. This will decide if the team wants you or not. Normally, in this interview, a team lead with a team member will interview you. They may ask you either technical or behavioral questions. Sometimes, they would ask you to solve coding challenges. So, be prepared!

Before the technical interview, an HR person should approach to learn about you first. In my opinion, this is not an important one. If an HR person calls you, you are likely selected for the next interview. However, you need to respond to the question right to make their job easier. Normally, they just want to make sure you are still interested in the position and open to the new job. They may ask your experience, but that is just for making sure the experiences you listed on your resume is correct. You may answer briefly, and not go too much into the technical.

If you do good in a technical interview, you will go to another view, where you will meet a director or manager. In this interview, you don't need to worry because you are likely selected. So, be nice and professional, you will receive the job offer at the end of the day.
