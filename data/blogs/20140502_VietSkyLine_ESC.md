### Introduction

This was my first project at VietSkyLine. At that time, the company attempted to research and develop an Electronic Speed Control Module, which controls the rotation of propellers on an UAV. I was the only engineer who was responsible for this project. The target was releasing the first demo of HW and SW design within one month.
