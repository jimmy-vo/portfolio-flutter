### Introduction
When I started working at ACE Project Space as a Software Developer and System Integrator, the team was stuck with the Bluetooth implementation on Unity for a month. The problem is Unity doesn't support Bluetooth. The only way to have it is to use Java Plug-in which they bought from the asset store. There were so many errors with those plug-ins but we could access to the source code inside. Developing a plug-in from scratch was a little bit challenging because there was no sample code and it was lack of documentation. I jumped in, and after a-week research, I could manage to create Bluetooth plugin for our project.
