### Meet the CTO
I first met the CTO of SolarSkyrise at the interview for my summer term. SolarSkyrise was one of [The three companies](blog/20190501) offered me a software developer position. Unfortunately, I chose another one.

About 8 months later, he got back to me with another offer. I really appreciated it that he still wanted me to work for him. I then realized working for a growing start-up with a leader like him is a good opportunity. I accepted the offer. It was the first official full-time job, right after I graduate in Canada. This job made my immigration process much easier.


### NorthForce Building - 100 Innovation Drive
Our office was sitting among other start-up companies. NorthForce provides modern and shiny facilities.

I was given a Macbook Pro. An Ultra wide monitor is helpful too, but I don't use it too often.

And here is my favorite place - the washroom. Haha. The window and the view behind are just so beautiful.

### A day in life of a System Developer
Because of my immigration status, I started working part-time in mid December 2019. Until mid January 2020, when I got all of the immigration documents resolved, I officially started my full-time job at SolarSkyrise.

In the first few week, I quickly get adapt to the new environment. I was so excited how flexible the team was. The working time is flexible. We didn't follow the traditional business operation. We mainly communicated through Slack, and constantly changing the process if we saw something did not work out.

Not like other businesses that I worked with, SolarSkyrise maintain open discussions where I can see and learn how marketing and funds raising work. We don't have meeting very often, which is both good and bad. The good thing is I did not have to wake up early in the morning and rushing to the meetings. On the other hand, sometimes I feel like I kind of missed the traditional way. 

The management side of SolarSkyrise is also flexible and open to new ideas. New ideas are welcome to bring to the table and discuss. People at SolarSkyrise seem more relaxing than any other organizations that I have been working for. I don't feel the pressure of deadlines even though we did have deadlines. It was more about doing things right, rather than getting things done quickly. It is also why they are always patient, when I bring up something cool. 

### Learn the new tech stack
At SolarSkyrise, I had a chance to work with a young, talented software architect. He defined the software architect and micro-services. I wasn't a fan of micro-services at the time because most of the software I worked with were packaged or compiled into a single piece. He spent time to convince me micro-services are the most appropriate solution to the company. He also showed me how to dockerize the micro-services. We used NodeJs and React for most of the things. We also used C#, C++ and Python some backend components as well. After we have everything working, we started to move gradually to (Aqueduct) Dart and Go.
