### Introduction
Getting the first paid-job as a part-time researcher at ACE Project Space, Red River College inspires me to share my experience in this post. I found my that journey is an interesting experience. It is not only just about how to be accepted by the industry, but also about how I improved myself, built the skill set. I hope these notes will be useful for the newcomers, who is also looking for the entry into the tech industry like me.

### The most difficult time in my life
If you know me, I came to Canada in 2017 with the financial support from my parents. I enrolled in the business information technology (BIT) program at Red River College. However, in the summer of 2018, because of some issues, my parents can no longer support me. I ran into a really bad situation, where I don't have enough money to pay the tuition fee. I was holding the study permit at that time. If I don't have a tuition fee I have to pack up and go back to my country.

Even though I came to Canada with the electrical engineer in the background and a few years of experience in the embedded system industry, The Canadian market is totally different and it was impossible to find a job in Canada. 

### Thanks for the supports around me
I told my friend, Vincent my story. He was a security guard before he enrolled in the BIT program. He opened his wallet and gave me all the money he has, which was about $300, And told me to get the security guard certificate. The money was just enough for the course fee, but I appreciate it because I knew I didn't have any other options.

### Took all the chances
In the meantime, I also started to work for two restaurants. The money I earned from restaurants would not be enough to pay the tuition fee. Even if I got a security guard certificate I could earn more money, but that still would not be enough. However, I didn't want to give up. I took all the chances I had. It took me a few weeks to complete the course to get the certificate.

Other than that, I also found an opportunity at ACE Project Space. They needed a student working on a funded project. But it was a volunteer position. I passed the interview after I showed the project manager my personal project I did a while ago ([Galaxy - VR spaceship shooting game](blog/20180612)), which was created with Unity. Unity was the core technology that was being used in the project.

Honestly, the two jobs at the restaurant drained all of my energy, plus I had to go to the security guard classes. I just did not want to give up on that volunteer job, which didn't give me any cents. I started to join the team sometime in July 2018 and did not know that would save my situation.

### The proposal
At the time I joined the team, they were building a Virtual Reality (VR) system, including an embedded system communicating with the VR application on a headset device. The embedded board reads data from the sensors mounted on the wheelchair.

After I figured out the system architecture of the project, I was so certain that the project was the real opportunity for me. I could do even more than just a volunteer positions.

I spent a month to prove my ability to the team with a [Bluetooth Plug-in](blog/20180630), to change the communication protocol from WIFI to Bluetooth, which saves more energy.

Around June 2018, I spent a week to write a proposal about the new system architect. In my proposal, I showed my knowledge about the [Object Orientation Estimation System](blog/20140505) I did in the past, which will be useful to the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). I also proposed the embedded software architect that can handle Bluetooth stack and digital signal processing. Other than that, I also started the hardware project, where I design the schematic and layout with a hardware engineer.

My proposal was accepted by the Chairman of the department. After the proposal, we sat down and discuss my current situation at that time. They decided to put me in a part-time researcher position and started to pay me monthly.

### Conclusion
In the first 3 years in Canada, this little achievement was the greatest memory that I will never forget. 

I am grateful to have Vincent as my friend, who was always there and help me out in the most difficult time in my life. Even though I got the security certificate, and never had a chance to work as a security guard, I still keep it with me. It reminds me to help the people around me, encourage the people on their way.

I am also thankful that the Chairman was open to new ideas and gave me that opportunity. He is one of the leaders I will never forget in my life.
