### Introduction
At VietSkyLine, I realized that Kalman Filter is the most challenging Machine Learning area in an UAV system. After I left the company, I decided to go deeper in this area. The project is a result after I investigated on many pieces of related published paper in 6 months. It includes Matlab modeling and simulating on many optimization approaches in the object-orientation-estimation system.

### Features:
* Input: raw data from Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer
* Output: Euler angles, Quaternion

### Approaches:
