### Introduction
After I graduated from Red River College, I started to work for SolarSkyrise. Since then, I had 3 interviews at other companies. In August 2020, I got 2 offers but I have decided to work for [Librestream](#section-1-999). This opportunity gave me a short break in the transition time. Thanks to that, I had some time to reflex on my achievements and my efforts so far.

As [a tech lead at OriGatou](#section-1-888), I have met many IT students, graduates, and also Software developers. OriGatou is a start-up, but it is very different from other start-ups. It doesn't keep the employees stay and work for the company. It focuses on building up its people's personal career, so the people stay just because we were doing cool stuff and help them move up on their careers. From time to time, I gave new members professional advice on how to develop their careers. It also inspires me to write a blog series about career tips in Software Development.

I hope it would help more people, not just the people in my connection, who are new to Canada and want to launch their career in Software Development. The series includes:
* [Career tips: Acknowledge the struggles](blog/20200827)
* [Career tips: Develop strategies](blog/20200828)
* [Career tips: Stuff you should know about interviews](blog/20200829)

### Build your resume/profile
One common mistake I could see from many other students is they don't look at the market. Vision could be a big word in this case, but I can't find other words to highlight my point.

Why vision is important? Wrong vision will drive you make wrong decision. A people with wrong vision can end up with unsuccessful career even though they are hard-working. 

Vision keeps you on the right track and doing the right thing. Most of the students I met were struggling with questions like how to pass courses or how to get higher grades. Of course having higher grades is important. However, what is the point if you get A+ in the PHP course but the company you are applying to doesn't use that old language. This is a simple thing that you may knew already. But school life may be too busy and too distractive so that you forget about the market demands out there. 

Let's put the bigger question. How to maintain a good vision? My trick is maintaining my resume continuously and constantly. And more importantly, you have to do it in the right way!

When I was in school, I didn't know anything about the market and didn't really know what to put on my resume. I did a lot of market research, read hundreds of job postings to figure out the market demands. I collected the skills the employers wants, acquired them and gradually put them on my resume. So if you are wondering what to study to be ready for the market, you need to create your own resume. But please remember, don't forget to look at the market. And also don't forget to update new skills whenever you learn a new programing language or a new technology.

If you are currently employed, please take a look at [Do not let your skills out-of-date](blog/20200827). If you think about the number of people were laid off because of the COVID-19, you can lose your job at any point. However, a resume, which is a summary of your skills and knowledge open other doors with even better opportunity. Every time I completed a task at work, I always thought about how I put it on my resume and how I can describe it in the future interview. That's why a good vision is important. It reminds you about the possible risks in your career, and motivates you do more than just complete tasks at work.


### Prioritize your study
The number one rule I tried not to break when I was a student: study is the most important thing. While you are in school, try your best to get all A, because that is the easiest way to show the employer. 

Some may argue employers will not pick you just because you have A. Yes they are right. But please also keep in mind that you should not give them a reason to throw your resume to the garbage just because there are so many applications that have A or even A+.

Please don't get me wrong. A good vision will show you the list of things besides the courses, you need prepare for your future career. But before getting to the advanced things, you need to do well the basics, which is your GPA.

### Learning new technologies
Everything in this technology industry changes so fast. You have to learn all the time to survive. Even if you have a good job, believe me, it is a honey trap, it will kill your career five years later if you are not conscious about the changing world. You may want to read my previous post about [Do not let your skills out-of-date](blog/20200827).

So, no matter how much experience you get in your country, it doesn't matter. Things are different in places and it is never a waste of time to explore the current tech world and keep your skills up-to-date.

### Prepare what you are going to show the employers
Sometimes in your career, you may find yourself a perfect fit for a position in a job posting that you have found. However, they just don't pick you and you don't really know why. One thing learned from my own unsuccessful interviews is not be able to show 100% of my abilities or my experience. Of course you won't be able to get to 100% because the interview time is too short. However, the more you prepare, the more you can impress the employers.

Some may argue that they find their interviews are too long and sometimes tricky. If you are in this group of people, I believe you didn't learn enough. So, you should take a step back, spend more time to learn more until you are more comfortable with most of the interviews.

For those who are quite confident with their skills and want to prepare better for interviews. My trick is to log everything I have done from the tasks in my full-time jobs, the personal projects I worked after work. You can write down on your notebooks. Or you can create a personal website like me where I could show my postings. Before every interview, I always review my notes, it helps me organize my experience and help me explain it better to the employers.

If usually get stuck while writing cover letters like me, a personal website helps a lot. An simple template I used all the time is as below:
```
Dear HR manager,

... I found your job posting and I am interested in the position.
[Begin the list of relevant experience]
I worked at [company], using [skills]. You can find more about it at [url1] or [url2], ...
[End the list of relevant experience]
...
```
As a software developer, you should be good at automation. Some parts of applying for new job can also be automated to save your time.

### Networking
It is undeniable that networking is so important to help you get the first job in Canada. The experience of networking is different depending on your personality and how you interact with other people. I am an introvert, so I guess it was more difficult to reach out to the people, compared to the extrovert. Plus, my English was not really good. But I found networking worked for me.

My first attempt was kind of awkward. I went to a Job Fairs in Winnipeg. I was struggling to approach them, because of my English. Starting a conversation with recruiters was difficult because I didn't go directly to the point. As a result, it took them some time to figure out my purpose and how I matched the position. Even though my skills matched the position, they would not take me further because I didn't have proper communication skills.

Some say networking is also a chance to get to know more people in the industry or even making friends. I found it never worked for me that way. Personally, I think everyone comes to a networking event for their own purpose, which is either finding jobs for looking for candidates. No one has time to make friends or even sharing their experiences. So my point is, if you leave a networking event with nothing, you are not alone. Honestly, I also thought that Job Fair is disappointingly useless.

But it was not. Later in real interviews, I found myself more confident and determined as I have gone through the introduction so many times at networking events. I know what recruiters want to hear, and how to impress them. Having better interview skills is not the only thing I get. I did get some good opportunities too. [Skip the dishes](https://www.skipthedishes.com/), [Wawanesa Insurance](https://www.wawanesa.com/) contacted me and ask me to contact them after I graduate. Unfortunately, I got a job right after I graduated, so I never know where those changes could lead me to. It could be possibly a better place than where I am now.
