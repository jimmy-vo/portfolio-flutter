### Introduction
What makes me happy the most is not the money that I could earn from the job, but the value I could contribute to the organization. I think the good employee should know his value and how he can add that to the business. This is a short story that I am proud of at SolarSkyrise.

### Figure out what to improve
What we were doing was creating production solar power reports. On our side, we gather and clean data, re-construct it into a proper form. Then we send our data through a third-party API where the remaining tasks are done on our partner's server. The third-party API helps us create solar irradiance mapping on the building facades and calculate production power.

This was good and bad. The good thing is it reduces the cost of development on complicated data processing. Those are the unknown thing we had not figured out at that moment. The bad thing is we have to pay them every month to be able to use that API. We also have to rely on them whenever we need to develop any customized data processing. So whenever we need to add any changes, we have to talk to people in France, and it didn't go well sometimes.

### The proposal
Create solar irradiance mapping is a complicated process. It includes direct and diffuse solar irradiance and Shadow processing. Fortunately with my background in Electrical Engineering, and the past years' experience in processing geometry data, plus I am pretty good at math, I knew how to come up with the numbers we wanted.

Then I proposed to my boss to rewrite the API. Of course, it is not an easy thing because the third party company is a 10-year start-up and it took them the same amount of time to build the system. However, I know the way how to get there. Technology changes over the years and with Unity, a game engine platform, I believe we can make it in less than a year.


### Result
After my presentation, he excepted my proposal. The proposal opens new ways to go in terms of technology development. It also creates a new market segment in the future.

I started to work on what I proposed around April 2020. It kept me busy for a while until September 2020, when I started the new job at Librestream. During that time I was able to demonstrate some features of the engine that I implemented. After I left, the development team kept working on the engine and added more features to my creation.

At SolarSkyrise, I am happy that my idea was accepted and recognized and I could work on the things that bring a bigger benefit to the company
