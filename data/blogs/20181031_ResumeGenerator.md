### Introduction
When I moved to Canada, I realized that it is very important to have a good Canadian resume with voluntary experience. I started to volunteer a lot to improve my soft skills. However, It was annoying to me to update my resume and my online portfolio after I worked in those events. So, I decided to automate that process with just one click.
