### Introduction
This is my first Android app and a gift to all my families and friends. I made the app after I finished the BIT's first term at Red River College, using the knowledge from Financial Accounting and Java programming class
The idea comes from my note taking habit as I noted all my expenses and transactions to the excel file. By the time, the file is so heavy. I needed to open my laptop whenever I want to see and adjust the file. Therefore I decided to bring it to Android, in which I can open my notes anywhere.
