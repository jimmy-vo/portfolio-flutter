### Introduction
This was my third project at at VietSkyLine. At that time, all the GPS sensors provided UART outputs. However, an UAV system uses the CAN network. In order to have GPS modules join the CAN bus, my boss assigned me this project. The target was researched and developed the UART-CAN conversion module
