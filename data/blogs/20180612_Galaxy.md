### Introduction
I still remember when I was a high school kid, I was so addicted to a game named "Galaxy On Fire" on my Symbian phone. At that time, I couldn't imagine that 8 years later, I would create a similar game and launch it on Google Play Store. This is my first Android VR game after I have learned some Unity skill sets from Dylan Fries's Unity workshops.
