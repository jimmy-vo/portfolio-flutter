### Introduction
After I graduated from Red River College, I started to work for SolarSkyrise. Since then, I had 3 interviews at other companies. In August 2020, I got 2 offers but I have decided to work for [Librestream](#section-1-999). This opportunity gave me a short break in the transition time. Thanks to that, I had some time to reflex on my achievements and my efforts so far.

As [a tech lead at OriGatou](#section-1-888), I have met many IT students, graduates, and also Software developers. OriGatou is a start-up, but it is very different from other start-ups. It doesn't keep the employees stay and work for the company. It focuses on building up its people's personal career, so the people stay just because we were doing cool stuff and help them move up on their careers. From time to time, I gave new members professional advice on how to develop their careers. It also inspires me to write a blog series about career tips in Software Development.

I hope it would help more people, not just the people in my connection, who are new to Canada and want to launch their career in Software Development. The series includes:

* [Career tips: Develop strategies](blog/20200828)
* [Career tips: Stuff you should know about interviews](blog/20200829)

### Explore Winnipeg and the struggles
I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and I have never moved to any other city in my life until I moved to Winnipeg. At first, I was struggling a lot when I started in the new city. Everything is different in the new city.

One of the things that shocked me was my language. When I was in Vietnam, speaking English was never a problem. Even though it is not my first language, I could use it at work very well. But when I moved to Canada, very soon I realized that people here don't speak or don't understand the English I used to speak. I remember the first time I went to Red River College, I could not even order a bugger. 3 years later, when I am writing this post, I am still not happy with my English. And I know I will never be happy with my English. I started to accept the fact that it is not my first language.

Another thing that broke my heart was the difficulty of getting a job in Canada. Life was so easy to me back in Vietnam. I lived in the same place where I was born and the first job when I was a second-year student. Right after I graduated from university, I picked one from the choices I had for the first full-time job. But in Winnipeg, I realized not many companies are involved in my field - Embedded Industry. Many people in the field ended up with no jobs for many years. But luckily, I have 3 years to be prepared (it's the length of the program).

### Do not let your skills out-of-date
I met a developer in a tech meetup Winnipeg, who has 20 years of experience. He worked for the government for many years and ended up losing his job and could not find another one. When I asked about his experience, he told me the only language he knew was COBOL which is very old.

The fact is, big companies hire employees and put them into work with a specific technology and become specialized in it. As the years went by, they get promoted as they are getting better in that tech stack everyday. But they forget one thing, the tech world is changing. You have to learn all the time to survive.

Yes, getting into the industry is difficult, surviving in the tech world is also one of the pressure. I am grateful that I could get a chance to expose to different experiences and stories that could help me prepare better for my future.

### Having a lot of experience do not guarantee to get a job
This is the story of a guy I found in Winnipeg, who I really enjoyed working with. He was an expert in Embedded System before he came to Canada 8 years before the time we met. He moved to provinces seeking for jobs until we had a chance to work together on a local client project. He is highly skilled, responsible, and dedicate. From what I heard from him, he migrated to Canada as a Permanent Resident. He took another engineering program to update his skills but ended up with no full-time job. I was quite surprised at that a highly skilled person like him could not find a job.

With a similar background, I really worried about my future at the time we talk. The fact is Embedded industry is popular in cheap labor countries, where the cost of R&D and manufacture is low. What I have learned from my buddy's journey is no matter how skillful you are, if your experience doesn't meet with the market demanding, your chances to get a job would be very low. Thanks to that, very soon, I decided to move to other fields that could possibly give me more opportunities.

### The fear of falling behind
I have been talking to a couple of developers, who share the fear of falling behind. Especially when you have a few years of experience in Software Development, but you decided to switch to another tech stack that you are not familiar with.

For example, in my case. I had a few years of experience in Embedded System Development back in Vietnam. I spent like 2 years to dig into all the aspects and the corners of Embedded System Engineering that I needed to know. When I decided to switch to another field, it was frustrating when I thought about a similar amount of effort I needed to spend on the new tech stacks.

Another thing that also frustrated me was that I had to accept to restart from the entry-level. However, very soon I realized my past experience could help me to flatten the new learning curves, which easily brought me to a higher level. Moreover, with many years of experience in debugging at the embedded system level, moving to the higher stack was easier for me. I found myself could spend more time on the ideas, software architect, and the infrastructure, not just how to code and how to do things properly.
