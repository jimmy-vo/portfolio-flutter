### Introduction
This was my first embedded system project. It was kind of important milestone in my life, when I started to realize what I should pursue later in life. My professor asked me to do something with STM34F407 with some of his suggestions. I decided to build A remote-controlled 4-wheel robot and challenge myself with controlling Ultrasonic sensors. I know it doesn't look nice, but worked quite acceptable.
