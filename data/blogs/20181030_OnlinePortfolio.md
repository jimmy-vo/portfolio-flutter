### Introduction
After I had finished the course Web Development 1 at RRC, I decided to make my own online portfolio. I found Linkedin was so limited to describe what I had done and to state myself. I want this online portfolio to be easier to edit the content with XML and auto generating script. Now, it becomes my own corner, where I can share my achievements, experiences, projects and what I believe. Moreover, thanks to the flexibility of it, I started write more, share more and contribute more.
